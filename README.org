* Yastylus-mode
Another major-mode for editing Stylus file (.styl)

Currently forked from the stylus-mode on MELPA; if I have free time I would rewrite the whole repo. The indentation behaviour and syntax highlight of current stylus-mode is too aweful.

maybe can enhance  https://github.com/vladh/stylus-mode/blob/master/stylus-mode.el
